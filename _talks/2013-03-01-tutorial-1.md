I was able to share a bit about my internship experience for a special edition on student internships in the College of Arts and Science's magazine.

I had the opportunity to chat with Janette Tannen, an author for News@TheU about the internship I had with the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department. It was a great opportunity to reflect on what I learned— from technical knowledge to future career insights.
