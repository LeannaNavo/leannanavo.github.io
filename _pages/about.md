Hello and welcome to my GIS portfolio! My name is Leanna Navo and I'm a senior at the University of Miami, triple majoring in Ecosystem Science & Policy, Geography & Sustainable Development, and Spanish. I’ve developed a strong interest in hydrogeology through my internship with Miami-Dade County Water and Sewer Department’s Hydrotechnical Services Division that took place from May to December of 2025. My internship exposed me to the relevance of GIS in natural resource management and engineering matters, from tracking saltwater intrusion to fulfilling regulatory obligations. Together with county geologists and consultants, I had the opportunity to explore real-world applications for GIS. I’m ready to get to mapping with a purpose!


> “Always say “yes” to the present moment. What could be more futile, more insane, than to create inner resistance to what already is? What could be more insane than to oppose life itself, which is now and always now? Surrender to what is. Say “yes” to life — and see how life suddenly starts working for you rather than against you.”
