My research team is collaborating with a reverse logistics company to publish a paper on material flows in the circular economy. We compiled a large dataset spanning 2.5 years and more than 23,000 shipments. I have used Python to extract spatial and temporal patterns from the data and to create graphical and cartographic visualizations. Statistical analyses are currently underway.
