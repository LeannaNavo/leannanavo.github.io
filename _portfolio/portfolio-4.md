My research team is collaborating with a reverse logistics company to publish a paper on material flows in the circular economy. We gathered a large dataset consisting of 2.5 years of data and more than 23,000 shipments. I have used python code to extract spatial and temporal patterns from the dataset as well as make graphical and cartographic figures. Statistical analyses are forthcoming.
